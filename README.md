## Purpose

The [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) is easy to use.
But I faced problems like maintainability and testability at more complicated IoT projects.
I needed to compile and flash the ESP32 before testing my code functionality by doing it 100% manually.

This solution transpiles Golang into Arduino code, which can be compiled to an image by using the ESP32 toolchain.
Now I am able to use a fully automated testing approach instead of doing it 100% manually.

**Important**:

The Transpiler only supports a small subset of the [Golang Language Specification](https://golang.org/ref/spec).
Look at the [mapping](https://github.com/andygeiss/esp32-transpiler/blob/master/transpile/handlers/mapping.go) and the [tests](https://github.com/andygeiss/esp32-transpiler/blob/master/transpile/service_test.go) to get the current functionality.
It is also not possible to trigger the C/C++ Garbage Collection, because Golang handles it automatically "under the hood".
Go strings will be transpiled to C constant char arrays, which could be handled on the stack.
